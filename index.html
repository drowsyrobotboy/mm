          <h1>You would probably want to know about me</h1>
          <p>Hi! I am Manish Maryada, an MS Finance student from Texas A&amp;M University. I am from the beautiful subcontinent India and was born and raised in the city of Hyderabad. Excellence .. Exuberant …Efficient…that’s what I am synonymous to ! I have done my under graduation from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology in the stream of Mechanical Engineering. Later, the world of finance amazed me and thus worked in HSBC Retail Banking and Wealth Management for a year. I have some really good experience as an intern in many firms especially in the field of business management. Texas A&amp;M has been my dream university and I feel proud to say that “Finally!I am an Aggie!” and pursuing finance in such a renown college is going to be a key part of my life.</p>

          <p>Talking about the fun stuff about me, I am a jack of many trades and a master of many of them. Photography and travelling, are a part and parcel of me. I enjoy playing cricket, chess, basketball, swimming and recently started following American football, thanks to A&amp;M. I love music and learnt carnatic music during childhood. One can’t separate food and me. I am a big foodie and love trying new cuisines and I also write reviews on websites.</p>
          <p>Finally,If someone asks me to describe myself in one word…”PERFECTIONIST”..that’s how I would like to describe myself! </p>
          <p>Now it’s time to know me in detail !</p>

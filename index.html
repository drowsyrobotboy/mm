          <h1>You would probably want to know about me</h1>
          <p><i>“My Curiosity is my Creativity on the way to Discovery”</i></p>
          <p>
          Hi! I am Manish Maryada, an MS Finance student from Texas A&amp;M University. I am from the beautiful subcontinent of India and was born and raised in the city of Hyderabad.</p><p>
          Excellence .. Exuberance ... Efficience ... that’s what I am synonymous with! I have completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology with a GPA of 3.65/4.0.While I have a comprehensive engineering background, I developed a keen interest and liking towards Financial and Business Management. Following my passion, I worked with HSBC – Rental Banking and Wealth Management for a year where I learnt all about the ABC’s of financial strategies and business operations.  I have some enriching experience as an intern in many firms especially in the field of business management. Texas A&amp;M has been my dream university and I feel proud to be an Aggie ! Pursuing finance in this renown college is going to be a key cornerstone in my life.</p><p>
          I am an ambitious, self-made, workaholic but down to earth person. If I was to describe my personality I would say that I am a jack of many trades and a master of them too. Photography and traveling, are a part and parcel of me and an integral part of my life. I enjoy playing cricket, chess, basketball and swimming. American football is my current addiction, thanks to A&amp;M. I love music and I am also a trained classical singer. Food plays a pivotal role in my everyday life and it makes me happy. I am a big foodie and love trying new cuisines and I also write reviews on websites.</p><p>

          One word that I would associate with myself is ”PERFECTIONIST” - it defines me in a nutshell.</p><p>

          Now it’s time to know me in detail….</p>

      <h1>Stem to Stocks</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          My under-graduation in Mechanical Engineer gave me some great skills. My analytical skills, problem solving skills, strategic thinking etc. have been polished to the saturation level. As I grew up, I gradually came to appreciate the importance of financial management in the modern world. I believe earning a master’s degree in finance would ideally complement my undergraduate degree in engineering and give me an overall development. I have chosen to pursue master’s studies in the US because it is home to many of the leading financial professionals and institutions in the world. The recent financial crisis has transformed the finance industry, and studying in the US is ideal for grasping the changes that are currently taking place in this field.
        </p>
        <p>To sum up as to why I took finance because: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The world of finance is huge, exciting and fun </li>
          <li>I will get a chance to challenge myself everyday </li>
          <li>I will be able to solve real-time problems </li>
          <li>Finally, who doesn’t want money! Because at the end of the day, Finance is the art of making money. Find me to become rich faster!</li>
